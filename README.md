# 🎉 Event Hub 🎉  

Event Hub is a simple and straightforward web project that organizes events into two categories: **Upcoming Events** and **Past Events**. This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Full-Stack Developer Curriculum**, focusing on practicing semantic HTML and structuring web pages.

## ✨ Features  

- 🖼️ **Header**: Includes a navigation bar for easy access to different sections.

- 🕰️ **Past Events**: Highlighting completed events, including event descriptions and images.  
- 🌐 **Semantic HTML**: Clear and readable structure for better accessibility.

## 📝 User Stories  

The following user stories are fulfilled in this project:  

1. **Header and Navigation**:  
   - 🏷️ The page includes a `header` element with an `h1` containing the title "Event Hub".  
   - 🔗 A `nav` element with an unordered list links to the **Upcoming Events** and **Past Events** sections.  

2. **Main Content**:  
   - 🎯 The `main` element contains two sections:  
     - **Upcoming Events** (`#upcoming-events`): Displays two articles with a title (`h3`), description (`p`), and optional date.  
     - **Past Events** (`#past-events`): Displays two articles with a title (`h3`), description (`p`), a date, and an image (`img`).

## 💅 CSS Styling  

While the original FreeCodeCamp lab test doesn't require CSS, it has been added here by me as a personal reference. You should add CSS of your own later when you've gotten a reasonable amount of proficiency in CSS. Key styling features include:

- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout adjusts smoothly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Modern Typography**: Utilizes web-safe fonts to enhance readability.
- **Color Scheme**: Applies a consistent color palette for a cohesive look and feel.
- **Hover Effects**: Adds subtle hover effects to navigation links and buttons for better interactivity.
- **Flexbox**: Utilizes Flexbox for aligning and distributing space among items in the layout.
